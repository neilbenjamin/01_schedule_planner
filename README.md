## How to install

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

#### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/neilbenjamin/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/neilbenjamin/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies isolation.

    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment (named '.venv' in this example)
    python3 -m venv .venv

    # Activate the virtual environment:
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows (Command Prompt):
    # .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # On Windows (PowerShell):
    # .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
    *Note: If you use a virtual environment manager like `virtualenvwrapper` or `pyenv-virtualenv`, you can use its equivalent commands (e.g., `mkvirtualenv your-project-name` and `workon your-project-name`) instead of the `venv` commands above.*

3.  **Install project dependencies:**
    With your virtual environment activated:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Database Migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

```bash
$ django-admin.py startproject \
  --template=https://github.com/jpadilla/django-project-template/archive/master.zip \
  --name=Procfile \
  --extension=py,md,env \
  project_name
$ mv example.env .env
$ pipenv install --dev
```

## Environment variables

These are common between environments. The `ENVIRONMENT` variable loads the correct settings, possible values are: `DEVELOPMENT`, `STAGING`, `PRODUCTION`.

```
ENVIRONMENT='DEVELOPMENT'
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='dont-tell-eve'
DJANGO_DEBUG='yes'
```

These settings(and their default values) are only used on staging and production environments.

```
DJANGO_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE='yes'
DJANGO_SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER='yes'
DJANGO_SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF='yes'
DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS='yes'
DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS=31536000
DJANGO_SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT=''
DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_HOST=''
DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT='yes'
DJANGO_SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER='HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO,https'
```

## Deployment

You can deploy to your choice of deployment options and based on those, you 
may need to reconfigure your settings to match the host deployment reqeuirements.
